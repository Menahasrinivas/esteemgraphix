          <h3>Getting Started</h3>

          <p>
            Upon receipt of advance deposit and/or contract, the customer service team in charge of your project will e-mail you to confirm receipt of your deposit, give you his/her contact information, and possibly ask you some questions about your project through phone call or questionnaire.
          </p>

          <p>
            Work will commence on the start date or the date payment is received, whichever is earlier. You will need to supply all text and/or product information to be included on your website as well as any other material you would like us to use such as company logo, personal photos, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have an outline it would also be helpful. In most cases, we would simply need to know what pages you intend to have (Home, About Us, Contact, etc) and what text/functionality you wish to offer on each page.
          </p>

        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="info-box">

          <p>
            For E-Commerce websites that require us to enter products for you, we will need you to supply an Excel Spread Sheet listing the following: Product Name, Product Number (if any), Product Description, Options (if any - size, color, etc), Price and approximate weight as well as the product photos named in correspondence with the item on the Excel spread sheet.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have any guide websites you would like us to refer to while designing your website or if you have any preference as to colors, style, etc. please relay that information as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ideally, all of the above information should be supplied prior to us getting started.
          </p>

          <p>
            In most cases, we will be able to provide you with 3 sample design layouts within 7 business days. After you have decided which design you would like to go with and we have completed any revisions you may have requested on the design, the necessary programming to make your website function will begin.
          </p>

          <p>
            The whole process should take approximately 2-4 weeks provided you have supplied the content required. We will be in constant contact during this time supplying links for you to review the progress and offer feedback.

    <!-- COMPLETION -->
    <div class="info-box mt-4 completion-box" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h3>Project Completion</h3>
      <p>
        After the website has been completed and you have confirmed that everything meet your needs, the final payment will need to be submitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        After final payment is received, we will upload all necessary files onto your hosting server and perform the necessary tests to confirm that everything is working properly.
